# Session Notes

## Deferred Items

- `roles.rs` in `nethack-data`: The plan calls for role/race/gender/alignment
  data tables but these were not generated by `extract_data.py`. The role data
  in `nethack/src/role.c` has a different structure (not simple macro calls) and
  would benefit from hand-porting or a separate extraction pass.

- Material enum has no variant for `0`: C uses material=0 for a few objects
  (worm tooth, strange object). Currently mapped to `Material::Liquid` as a
  placeholder. May need a proper `None`/`Unspecified` variant.

- `extract_data.py` expected counts (384 monsters, 454 objects) differ from the
  original plan's estimates (393, ~428) because the plan didn't account for
  `#if 0` blocks (9 DEFERRED/OBSOLETE monsters, 4 DEFERRED objects) and
  miscounted objects.

- The `#ifdef MAIL` scroll is included in the count (MAIL is typically defined
  in NetHack builds).
